# main file to run experiments
# This file is responsible for running the GAN training and evaluation
# and includes the main function to execute the script.

# There should be an argument parser to allow the user to specify which dataset to use, which informative/random subset
# For good science we should run the same experiment multiple times (3-5) and average the results
# and save the results to a file
