# GANs-Data-Diet
Recent research has shown that state-of-the-art machine learning models can be trained effectively using only specific subsets of training data. These "informative samples" enhance generalization in neural networks. While this phenomenon has been observed in supervised learning, this project aims to investigate whether similar informative samples exist when training generative models like GANs.
